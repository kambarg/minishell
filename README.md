# Minishell

This is my and [WorodHazim](https://github.com/WorodHazim)'s version of the Minishell project for 42 Abu Dhabi.

## Introduction

Minishell is a team project in the 42 curriculum, and I worked on it together with [WorodHazim](https://github.com/WorodHazim). You can find the project description here [Minishell](https://github.com/kambarg/minishell/blob/main/docs/minishell.en.subject.pdf). While the documentation is quite inspiring from the very first line, I found that the overall scope of Minishell‚Äîas a mini version of Bash‚Äîwas not clearly defined. I implemented it based on my own interpretation, and some missing features may have been intentionally left out.

Anyway this project really taught me a lot. And the amazing 42 Abu Dhabi community played a huge role in my learning journey.
Special thanks to my partner-in-crime, **wuabdull**!
Sincere thanks also to **meid** and **zzetoun** for the mock evaluations, and to **hmensah**, **hamalmar**, and **reahmed** for the official evaluations.
I‚Äôm also deeply grateful to all the students who helped me understand key concepts and generously shared their implementation approaches.
(*P.S. I used 42 intra usernames here, but if you'd prefer to be mentioned by your GitHub username‚Äîor not mentioned at all‚Äîplease feel free to reach out!*)

The `main` branch contains the version I'm currently satisfied with. I‚Äôm aware that the code could benefit from further refactoring but I‚Äôve decided to pause for now. I have added a few minor fixes based on feedback during evaluations and may continue to make small updates if necessary. I'm happy to share my code openly‚Äîfeel free to submit issues if you‚Äôd like to suggest improvements or point out anything you believe needs reconsideration. To me, Minishell is a never-ending learning journey.
